		<p>Hi, my name is Andie Carroll and I can't wait to tell you about my past summer in Tel Aviv. 
			But first, here is a little bit about me! 
			I'm from New Canaan, CT and live with my mom and sister.
			I'm a Junior at the University of Michigan studying UX Design and Economics. 
			I am passionate about design and hope to work in technology after I graduate in 2023.

		<p>Some of my hobbies include skiing, hiking, and cooking. I love the outdoors and became obsessed with long walks during quarantine.
			I also love hanging out with my friends, trying new foods and restaurants, and traveling. 
			My dream is to travel around the whole world one day.
			At school I am a member of my soroity Delta Gamma, where I have made my friends for life. 
			I am also a member of the first ever design fraternity called Alpha Theta Delta and was just named the incoming Vice President.

		<p>
			Fun fact about me is that before I went to Israel this summer I spent the last 11 summers going to sleep away camp with my best friends in Penn Yan, NY.
			Luckily I was able to travel with a few of them to Tel Aviv this summer all on the same program. It was great to feel at home so far away from my family.
